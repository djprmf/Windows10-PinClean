# PinClean - Windows 10

This is a simple BAT file that clean all the taskbar pinned apps. Works in ANY version from Windows 10.

The BAT removes the files/registry related with the pinned taskbar apps, forcing all to be removed even when that is not possible by normal ways (for instance, some blocked app).
After the clean, explorer.exe is restarted. No need to restart the computer.

**NOTE**: Run as ADMIN!
